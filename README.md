# To run into your system
This program is created in Java. Unit testing done with the **JUnit framework** of Java. It is having a code coverage of **88.5%**. 

One need to either download the code or clone the repository to the local machine.

To run this program into your system, it is required to have a **JDK** installed into running into your system.

I have my **Java version "11.0.3"** installed into the system.


This program can run through 2 methods:
* IDE
* Command Prompt

__1. IDE__

We can use any of the IDE such as *Netbeans, IntelliJ, Eclipse* etc.

I have used Eclipse for this purpose.

Follow the below steps:

1. Open your Eclipse IDE.
2. Go to __File__ menu.
3. Select __Import__ option.
4. Open the __Git__ option.
5. Select the __Projects from Git__ option. Click on __Next__ button.
6. Select the __Existing local repository__ from the given option. Click on __Next__ button.
7. Click on __Add__ button. 
8. Click on the __Browse__ button, and select the location of clone folder.
9. You see the path on the given IDE and then click on the __Finish__ button. And then click on __Next__ button.
10. Import the project to the working tree selecting the __Import existing Eclipse project__ option and click __Next__ button. 
11. And click on __Finish__ button.
12. Run the class file __ConvertToString.__ 
13. Open the __Console__ and enter the number to be converted.

__2. Command Prompt__

Running a program through a *Command Line Interface* is something very easy and hassle free. Given you have your variable **CLASSPATH** set properly.

After cloning or downloading the source code,open the **CommandLine(CMD)** and go to source location via CMD, inside *stringConversion* folder you will find the src folder which contains the *.java* files for the code. Run the following command:

```bash
javac ConvertToString.java
```

After the execution you would notice that at *source location* you can find another file with *.class* extension created. Now run this .class file and *Enter the number you want to convert.* 

To do that exceute the following command.

```bash
java ConvertToString
```
Running these command will get the desired results.

In these ways, one can run this program into there systems.
